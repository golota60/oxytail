Working pipleline should be:

When creating a theme package, it uses `oxytail-base`. The end user install only the `oxytail-theme-*` package.

How to switch themes dynamically then? This is one of the benefits of DaisyUI which we wanna preserve.

I think just installing N themes and switching out global state between them should be sufficient
